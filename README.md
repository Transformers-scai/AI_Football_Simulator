# Transformers AI Football Simulator

Welcome to **Transformers Team AI Football Simulator** - a Unity-based soccer simulation enhanced with AI-powered player intelligence. This project combines traditional game development with modern artificial intelligence to create dynamic, realistic soccer behaviors.

## Overview

Soccer Legends is an experimental framework that bridges game development and AI research. It features:

- A complete Unity soccer simulation environment
- AI-driven player behaviors developed in Jupyter notebooks
- Foundation for integrating language models into sports simulations

##  Key Features

### AI-Enhanced Gameplay
- Intelligent player movement and positioning
- Decision-making algorithms
- Potential for LLM-integrated player dialogue

### Technical Implementation
- Unity 3D environment with C# scripting
- Python-based AI logic
- Jupyter Notebook interface for behavior development
- Modular architecture for easy expansion
